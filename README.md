## Technologies

## Description
This component displays an NFT card with an image overlay effect and interactive hover states. When the user hovers over the card, a semi-transparent overlay appears on the image along with an eye icon, and the title color changes to provide a subtle interactive experience.

## What I Learned
- How to structure a card component using semantic HTML.
- How to apply an overlay effect on an image using CSS.
- How to change styles on non-direct child elements using the CSS :hover and sibling selectors.

## Challenges
- Implementing the overlay on the image correctly without affecting the layout.
- Using :hover to target and change elements that are not direct children (employed the general sibling ~ selector).
